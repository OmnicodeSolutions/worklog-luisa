Today is Friday, day 321 of 365 (87.94%). We're in week 46 of 52 (88.46%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish unit tests for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)
- [ ] work on [issue#1](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1) from [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today I still had troubles with the unit tests, I thought the problem had something to do with the [Future Builder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html) so I tried to fix it in that direction. I did find some things, but I was not able to implement them correctly, so the tests are still wrong.

I was not getting anywhere so I stopped for a while and learned a bit of Ruby with Mauricio.

## Learnings

Today I learned about Flutter's [Completer class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Completer-class.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAu9yqBhBmEiwAHTx5p1ga2pnPKYLDpko9prXWVUporG4RoXFIrDLCm2JAdKNYKPsCxTYaFRoCYfQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) that can be used to create Future objects and resolve (complete) them later.

I laso learned about the SOLID Principles (see [Readings](#readings)).

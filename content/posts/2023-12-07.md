Today is Thursday, day 341 of 365 (93.42%). We're in week 49 of 52 (94.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] write tests for the [API](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial)

## Activities executed

Today I started writing tests for the [API views](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/blob/main/tutorial/snippets/views.py). I was not able to finish the tests, apparently the POST request is not geing sent correctly, but I couldn't figure out how to check that, so I'll finish it tomorrow.

## Learnings

Today I learned about [testing with Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/). I learned about the APIRequestFactory class, it has all the `.get()`, `.post()`, `.delete()` methods, amongst others. I also used pudb to hep debug the code.

From now on I will be pushing everythin I do to the remote repository in the end of the day, even if does not work/ins not finished. T do that I can just add the files and commit them as "wip", then, the next day, I undo that commit and update the remote repository like so:

To commit the files:
```bash
git add <files>
gcmsg "wip"
gp
```

To undo the commit and update remote repository:
```bash
git reset ~HEAD
gpf
```

Note that, `gp`, `gcmsg` and `gpf` are aliases of oh-my-zsh's git plugin.

Today is Tuesday, day 311 of 365 (85.20%). We're in week 45 of 52 (86.53%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] [start Flutter client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/)

## Activities executed

Today I started a Flutter client for the [DRF API](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial) I created yesterday. For now, it just returns all the attributes of a snippet. While I was thinking about how to do the rest of the client it occured to me that I didn't have access to all of the languages and styles from the API, so I asked Maurício and he said to create an endpoint with that information.

## Learnings

Making the endpoint I mentioned in the previous section was quite tricky and it took me some time and help to realize it was way more simple than what I was trying because:
1. there was no need for a options serializer;
2. there was no need for a options model.

In order to finish it I used the [APIView](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/) to create a OptionsView class that returns a map of the languages and style choices determined in the [models.py](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/blob/main/tutorial/snippets/models.py) file. Lastly, I added a new path to the urlpatterns in [urls.py](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/blob/main/tutorial/snippets/urls.py) that links to the view.

Today is Tuesday, day 283 of 365 (77.53%). We're in week 41 of 52 (78.84%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] update blog
- [x] [continue to configure github-actions to test dart exercices](https://github.com/LuCCoelho/Exercism-Solutions/issues/1)

## Activities executed

Today I added links to my Dart exercices in the [2023-10-04 page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/main/content/blog/2023-10-04.md) and finished to configure github-actions to test them, it runs a bash script that uses [set -euo pipefail](https://dougrichardson.us/notes/fail-fast-bash-scripting.html) to exit with non 0 error code so that the gh-actions will fail.

I also removed the warnings on the Dart exercises so that the gh-actions workflow would pass, in order to do that I removed the strong-mode mode from the [static analysis](https://dart.dev/tools/analysis) settings, since the configurations used were no longer supported.

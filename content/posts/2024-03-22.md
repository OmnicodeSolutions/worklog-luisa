Today is Friday, day 082 of 366 (22.40%). We're in week 12 of 52 (23.07%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Fix author redirection](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/136)
- [ ] [Add button to toggle languages](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/137)

## Activities executed

Today I fixed the redirection to the author page: when you clicked on the name in the blog page, it was always leading to the English version of the author page. I immediately thought it probably had something to do with that `lang` parameter from `get_taxonomy` since here we are using `get_taxonomy_url`. I did a quick research to make sure the function had that parameter, and all I had to do was add `lang=lang` in the [publish metadata macro](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/main/themes/adidoks/templates/macros/page-publish-metadata.html).

I started making the toggle button and got it to work for the home page and the blog section, but I got stuck while trying to make it work for the blog's pages.

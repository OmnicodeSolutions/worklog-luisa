Today is Monday, day 064 of 366 (17.48%). We're in week 10 of 52 (19.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I finished reading the Navigation class but still was not able to get the last test to pass. I replaced all of the remaining navigation calls with the new routing logic thinking maybe that would do it, but it didn't.

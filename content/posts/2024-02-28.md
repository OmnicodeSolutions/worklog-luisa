Today is Wednesday, day 059 of 366 (16.12%). We're in week 09 of 52 (17.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I realized that by fixing the [view -> login test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/3903e1a7c6567808555c08c0a3ede2c9b97fffb2/test/view_snippets_test.dart#L113C3-L128C6), I broke the [login -> view test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/3903e1a7c6567808555c08c0a3ede2c9b97fffb2/test/login_test.dart#L156C3-L181C6). I think this has something to do with going back on a route. I didn't find any other articles talking about stubbing, so I guess I'm on my own.

I also discovered that the logout is not being done. When I do the GET request from the app, it returns a 500 status code and a huge error message when I try doing it from the terminal. I'm getting really stuck in all this, and maybe stubbing instead of mockito was just a bad idea.

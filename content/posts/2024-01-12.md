Today is Friday, day 012 of 366 (3.27%). We're in week 02 of 52 (3.84%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] start making tests for [snippets view page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/view_snippets.dart)

## Activities executed

Today I started and finished the tests for the snippets view page. After that, I began working more on the [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart) since it needs to cover a lot more functionality. For now, I changed it to require one more argument, which is the snippet ID, so that I can use it to retrieve the correct information from the API. I created the [function for that in the APIService class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/2801bff5aa92c5e0bcdacfef137bee21266065cc/lib/api_service.dart#L35C3-L47C4).

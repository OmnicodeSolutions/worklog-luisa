Today is Tuesday, day 346 of 365 (94.79%). We're in week 50 of 52 (96.15%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] differentiate development and production constants for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today I sarted trying to use the Dart plugin [flutter_config](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_config) to differentiate development and production constants, but I couldn't test it. The plugin only supports Android/iOS platofrms, which shouln't be a problem, since I ran other apps on my phone before, but for some reason this time the notification to authorize access was not showing up. I tried restarting my phone, changing the notification settings, desabeling the USB Debugging option and enabling it again, shutting off developer mode completly and then activating it again, I also tried all the USB ports and two different cables, but none of it worked. After all this trouble, I decided to try running the app with Android Studio, but I got some weird errors that are nor appearing in VSCode.

## Learnings

Today I learned about the flutter_config plugin from Dart, to use it you have to 

1. Install the plugin:

```bash
flutter pub add flutter_config
```

2. Create a `.env` file in root of the app and write your constants using the syntax:

```
CONST_NAME=sometext
OTHER_CONST=someothertext
```

3. Import the package and load the constants in `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_config/flutter_config.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await FlutterConfig.loadEnvVariables();

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

4. Use the `get()` method to access your constants anywhere in the app (don't forget to import the plugin if it's in another file):

```dart
import 'package:flutter_config/flutter_config.dart';

FlutterConfig.get('CONST_NAME') // returns 'sometext'
```

I didn't get to this part yet, but to use `FlutterConfig` in the tests you have to load the values, this is the example in the [documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_config#:~:text=iOS%20Setup%20Guide-,Testing,-%23):

```dart
import 'package:flutter_config/flutter_config.dart';

void main() {
  FlutterConfig.loadValueForTesting({'BASE_URL': 'https://www.mockurl.com'});

  test('mock http client test', () {
    final client = HttpClient(
      baseUrl: FlutterConfig.get('BASE_URL')
    );
  });
}
```

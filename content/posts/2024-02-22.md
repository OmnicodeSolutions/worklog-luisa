Today is Thursday, day 053 of 366 (14.48%). We're in week 08 of 52 (15.38%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I started making tests for all the other buttons on the app, but I ran into a few bumps along the way and wasn't able to finish. Something's off with the [save button on the add snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/b29aafc2feaa43358ce274b268e9346578bf5ff9/lib/add_snippet.dart#L194C25-L209C23), and it's not working when I try to use the [Routing class logic](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/b29aafc2feaa43358ce274b268e9346578bf5ff9/lib/add_snippet.dart#L29C2-L32C4) to redirect the user back to the [view snippets page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/view_snippets.dart) once the new snippet is posted.

I also realized that I need to make more tests; I'm just not sure if they are for the [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/edit_snippet.dart) or the view snippets page. But right now, there is no test to assert that if there are more than one snippet in the view snippets page, each one leads to the edit snippet page with the correct information (id, owner, title, code, linenos, language, and style).

There is also something wrong with the ['loads next page if username and password are correct' test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/b29aafc2feaa43358ce274b268e9346578bf5ff9/test/login_test.dart#L135C3-L155C1). I honestly don't even remember changing it at all, so maybe it's the new navigation logic that's throwing it off, and I have to change how I check that.

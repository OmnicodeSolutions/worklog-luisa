Today is Tuesday, day 065 of 366 (17.75%). We're in week 10 of 52 (19.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Install adidocks theme to this blog](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)

## Activities executed

Today I forgot about Flutter and went back to the blog to try and install the [adidoks theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/adidoks/). I cloned the repository but was having a hard time figuring out how to apply the theme to the content I already have. After reading [this Zola page](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%97Using%20a%20theme,you%20cloned%20the%20theme%20in.), I realized that using the templates was a lot easier than I thought; you literally just have to assume you are already inside the templates file, even if you are using a theme. However, when I did that, I got this weird error:

```bash
Error: Failed to build the site
Error: Failed to render pager 10
Error: Reason: Failed to render 'blog/section.html'
Error: Reason: Macro namespace `macros_publish` was not found in the template `blog/section.html`. Have you maybe forgotten to import it, or misspelled it?
```

Which is complaining about something missing in the template from the theme. When I investigated, I realized that `blog/section.html` extends `section.html`, which extends `base.html`. In `base.html`, all these macros are imported, and that's what Zola wasn't finding in the template I was using in the blog's index, so I copied all of them to `blog/section.html`. That didn't do anything, but it also didn't fix everything: some of the configuration was applied, but apparently, the CSS was not loaded.

## Learnings

Today I learned that you can create a template with the same name as a template from a theme to override it. For example:

```bash
templates/pages/post.html -> replace themes/simple-blog/templates/pages/post.html
templates/macros.html -> replace themes/simple-blog/templates/macros.html
static/js/site.js -> replace themes/simple-blog/static/js/site.js
```

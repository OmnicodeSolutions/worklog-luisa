Today is Friday, day 335 of 365 (91.78%). We're in week 48 of 52 (92.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] finish unit tests for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today I was finally able to finish the tests. I didn't have to switch back to nock. I just had to implement a few more things from [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito).

I also did some rearranging in the project's structure and renamed a few things based on Clean Code.

## Learnings

Today I learned that to make mockito work I had to use the `@GenerateNiceMocks` annotation to tell mockito which classes to mock and Dart's [build runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) to generate a .mock.dart file. In the end, the code looks kinda like this:

```dart
@GenerateNiceMocks([MockSpec<ClassName>()])
import 'file_name_test.mocks.dart';
```

and after adding that you have to run:

`dart run build_runner build`

to generate file_name_test.mocks.dart.

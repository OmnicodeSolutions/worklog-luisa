Today is Friday, day 019 of 366 (5.19%). We're in week 03 of 52 (5.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] configure [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button
- [x] fix edit snippet page overflow error
- [ ] fix logout button

## Activities executed

Today I did some research on how to fix the logout button, but I couldn't find anything that really helped, so a switched to fixing the overflow. I had to go throght some different possible answers until I found [this on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70612950/6618622) and turns out all I had to do was follow it.

## Learnings

Today I learned about the `resizeToAvoidBottomInset` property from [Scaffold](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html), that basically tells Flutter if it should resize the page to fit the keyboard (or something else that takes over the bottom of the page) or just let the later cover it, it's default is true, but it couldn't shrink the elements, so they ended up bigger than the screen space availabel.

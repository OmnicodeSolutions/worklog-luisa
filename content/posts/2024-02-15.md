Today is Thursday, day 046 of 366 (12.56%). We're in week 07 of 52 (13.46%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish view snippets new test
- [ ] create tests for all buttons


## Activities executed

Today I did a lot of research on how to test Navigation in Flutter and tried a method, but it didn't work. Since this is the knowledge I need to make the tests for all the other buttons, I was not able to do that either.

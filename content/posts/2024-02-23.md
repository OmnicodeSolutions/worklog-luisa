Today is Friday, day 054 of 366 (14.75%). We're in week 08 of 52 (15.38%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I tried to fix he failing tests, but I couldn't do it. I started with the ['loads next page if username and password are correct' test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/b29aafc2feaa43358ce274b268e9346578bf5ff9/test/login_test.dart#L135C3-L155C1), but nothing seemed to work and I'm not even sure exactly what is wrong with. After a couple hours I got really frustrated and moved on to the ['logout button leads to login page' test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/c8e37070e3e7c3c1702ae3e086b1e4d54a91bfd2/test/view_snippets_test.dart#L113C3-L129C6) to see if I could work that one out, but I couldn't do it either. I think I gonna focus on something else tomorrow, I'll probably start with the new tests for checking if the snippet displayed once we click in the details button is the right one to get that out of the way.

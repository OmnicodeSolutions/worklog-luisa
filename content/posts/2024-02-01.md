Today is Thursday, day 032 of 366 (8.74%). We're in week 05 of 52 (9.61%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] finish tests for the [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/cea58173b6fb599882896675da9f05dd0f3a30af/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L9C1-L9C43)

## Activities executed

Today I had a lot less time, since I'm going to CIEE to leave them a printed copy of the internship contract so I only had time to finish the tests. After some more reaserch I gave up on trying to find a way to check is the inputs are read only/disabled instead I just try to type/tap them and check that nothing has changed. I also check if the "can't edit snippet" message only appears when the user is not the owner.

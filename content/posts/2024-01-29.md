Today is Monday, day 029 of 366 (7.92%). We're in week 05 of 52 (9.61%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button
- [x] make [dropdowns](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/ab2e876bc3079127b01983f32ff9eb557de71c3b/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L192C21-L234C23) read only if the user is not the snippet's owner

## Activities executed

Today I was able to make the dropdowns "read only" if the user is not the snippet's owner. In reality, I had to add a new widget to replace the dropdown button. I also disabled the save button in the same case, but I was not able to make the PUT request work.

There is something weird going on with the tests. The [empty username test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/15f4b7f494e16db93940d156ffc2f269ed7e4e55/test/login_test.dart#L46C3-L59C6) passes on VSCode but fails in the command line, so I'll have to look into that.

## Learnings

Today I learned about the [Visibility widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Visibility-class.html), which offers you a way to set a condition for a widget to be visible, as well as a replacement widget in case it is not:

```dart
Visibility(
    replacement: // widget to be shown if visibility is false
    visible: // boolean function to determine whether the child widget is visible,
    child: //...
)
```

I also learned that to disable a button in Flutter, you can set the `onPressed` parameter to `null`. To make it easier to read, you can do something like this:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: !boolFunction() ? null : () {}
    child: //...
)
```

Today is Wednesday, day 010 of 366 (2.73%). We're in week 02 of 52 (3.84%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] fix warnings on [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1)
- [x] start the [snippets CRUD](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/2)

## Activities executed

Today I fixed the warning about immutable classes on the Flutter Client, but the [CI was still broken](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/actions/runs/7474000014/job/20339271872) only on gh-actions. Luckly, it was an easy fix. All I had to do was change `findsOne` to `FindsOneWidget`.

I also created a [new function in the API Service class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/17d2d31a1081dbab95d469fa90b0631212a0d6ff/lib/api_service.dart#L22C1-L34C2) to fetch the snippets from the API and started the [snippets page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/view_snippets.dart), but I'm having some trouble with displaying the items.

## Learnings

Today I learned that you can add:

```dart
///ignore: must_be_immutable
```

above a class declaration so `flutter analyze` will not warn you if that class is not immutable.

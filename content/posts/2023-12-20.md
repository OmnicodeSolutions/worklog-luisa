Today is Wednesday, day 354 of 365 (96.98%). We're in week 51 of 52 (98.07%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] continue working on [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1)'s login page

## Activities executed

Today I did some nice progress in the Flutter Client login situation. The login page works just fine, it correctly saves the token in a static variable that can be accessed from any other class. 

I changed the project so that [`constants.dart`](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/lib/constants.dart) uses the variables from the [`.env`](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/.env) file and the rest of the code uses the constants from `constants.dart`.

I cleaned up the code: removed `print()` methods and unnecessary comments.

Lastly, I started making the [tests for the login](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/test/login_test.dart), the first ones were quite easy, they test for empty username, password and both, the forth one is going to test that the token is an empty string if the username and password are not valid, but I coundn't finish it today, since I had some trouble with the Dart SDK version, which I was only able to fix at the very end of the morning: when I ran `dart run build_runner build` to create the mock for the [`login(username, password)`](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/d24b453d881fa1177a5d5dc119a745058abbb0a4/lib/login.dart#L16C3-L29C4) method it wouldn't work, this is what is said:

```bash
Resolving dependencies...
The current Dart SDK version is 3.1.5.

Because luisa_drf_flutter_client depends on flutter_test from sdk which
  requires SDK version >=3.2.0-0 <4.0.0, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try using the Dart SDK version: 3.2.3. See https://dart.dev/get-dart.
```

At first I thought there was something wrong with Dart and I had somehow messed up the PATH again, but I solved it by just installing a later version of Dart in asdf. I'm not sure why the required minimum version changed, the only thing I can think of is upgrading flutter did it.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to fill text fields using `enterText()` method:

```dart
    await tester.enterText(find.byType(TextField), 'hi');
```

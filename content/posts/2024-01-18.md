Today is Thursday, day 018 of 366 (4.91%). We're in week 03 of 52 (5.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] configure [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button

## Activities executed

Today I was not able to finish the edit snippet page's button, because I don't know what's wrong with the API. When I change something and click PUT it doesn't edit the snippet and I have no idea why. Instead I tried adding a logout button, but Flutter keeps saying the endpoint is not on the .env file:

```bash
I/flutter (28186): FlutterConfig Value for Key(LOGOUT_ENDPOINT) not found
I/flutter (28186): Ensure you have it in .env file
```

I changed the [back button](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/a9cdc90bc3dce679613fb526ee0492d48b56392a/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L47C11-L55C15) in the edit snippet page and now it's on the app bar, instead of the page's body.

I also discovered the page has the same overflow error from before, but only when the keyboard opens, so I'll have to look into that.

## Learnings

Today I learned a lot about the [AppBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html) and how you can add and rearenge objects in it. For example, I added the back button before the app's name, and for that I had to set the `automaticallyImplyLeading` property to false and add a [GestureDetector](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html) to the `leading` property, it looks something like this:

```dart
AppBar(
    title: const Text('AppBar'),
    automaticallyImplyLeading: false,
    leading: GestureDetector(
    onTap: () {
        Navigator.push(
            context,
            MaterialPageRoute(
                builder: (context) =>
                    const OtherPage()));
    },
    child: const Icon(Icons.arrow_back),
    ),
)
```

You can also add more GestureDetectors using the `actions` property, that accepts a list of widgets. You can use Row, Padding, Container, or anything else to arrenge them however you want.

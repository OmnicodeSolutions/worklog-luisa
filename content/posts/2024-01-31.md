Today is Wednesday, day 031 of 366 (8.46%). We're in week 05 of 52 (9.61%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] fix failing tests
- [x] create tests for the rest of the [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/cea58173b6fb599882896675da9f05dd0f3a30af/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L9C1-L9C43)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to fix the tests that were failing and wrote some more, but there are still a few missing.

The [empty username test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/64b9edcbbd362a307c3c2a9f143e18e164cf9765/test/login_test.dart#L48C3-L63C6) was failing only when I ran all tests together because the text fields don't get cleared once each test has ended. So, all I had to do was write an empty string in the username field. I also changed the [empty password test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/64b9edcbbd362a307c3c2a9f143e18e164cf9765/test/login_test.dart#L31C2-L46C6) to write an empty string in the password field, just to make the tests cohesive.

As for the [dropdown menus populated with data from API test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/64b9edcbbd362a307c3c2a9f143e18e164cf9765/test/edit_snippet_test.dart#L65C3-L96C6), it wasn't finding the dropdowns because of the Visibility widget, which was always returning false. So, I had to mock [EditSnippetState()](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/64b9edcbbd362a307c3c2a9f143e18e164cf9765/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L23C7-L23C23) and add the mock as a parameter for the [EditSnippet class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/64b9edcbbd362a307c3c2a9f143e18e164cf9765/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L13C3-L17C33) so that [isOwner()](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/64b9edcbbd362a307c3c2a9f143e18e164cf9765/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L42C3-L50C4) could use the mock's function if the parameter is different than null. A very similar fix to what I did with the [Login class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/64b9edcbbd362a307c3c2a9f143e18e164cf9765/lib/login.dart#L9C7-L9C12).

The tests that are still missing are the ones that check if the fields are read-only/disabled when the user is not the owner, but I couldn't figure out how to test if a text field is read-only, so I'll have to do that tomorrow.

As a bonus, I added a [little message](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/64b9edcbbd362a307c3c2a9f143e18e164cf9765/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L135C25-L146C27) that tells the user they can't edit another user's snippet when they are not the owner.

## Learnings

Today I learned that you can use:

```dart
MediaQuery.of(context).size.width
```

to get the device's width. You can also get the height and other device-dependent information with [`MediaQuery`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQuery-class.html).

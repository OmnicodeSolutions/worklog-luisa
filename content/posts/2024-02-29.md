Today is Thursday, day 060 of 366 (16.39%). We're in week 09 of 52 (17.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I continued to try and fix the [login -> view test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/3903e1a7c6567808555c08c0a3ede2c9b97fffb2/test/login_test.dart#L156C3-L181C6), but I was not successful. I'm reading the entire Navigation class file; I only went through half of it today.

Today is Friday, day 286 of 365 (78.35%). We're in week 41 of 52 (78.84%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [ ] [continue Dart track on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/dart)

## Activities executed

Today I did the folowing exercises on Exercism's Dart track:
1. [difference-of-squares](https://github.com/LuCCoelho/Exercism-Solutions/tree/main/dart/difference-of-squares)
2. [word-count](https://github.com/LuCCoelho/Exercism-Solutions/tree/main/dart/word-count)

In the process of resolving the second one, I learned what [Iterables are and how they behave in Dart](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Iterable-class.html) and how to use [regular expressions in Dart](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.14.4/dart-core/RegExp-class.html).

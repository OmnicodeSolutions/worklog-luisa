Today is Tuesday, day 079 of 366 (21.58%). We're in week 12 of 52 (23.07%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Translate all elements of the pages in portuguese](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)
- [x] [Change script so that it also renames and moves blog_pt_br's files](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)

## Activities executed

Today I tried finding a way to translate the search bar's label in the header, but couldn't find a way to get the page's language. Because `base.html` is a custom template (unlike `page.html` that is recognized by Zola and already has the `page` variable), I can't seem to find a way to know which page I'm at and get that language code. I might have to go back to the old method with this one and make a macro for the entries in Portuguese. I also realized that the month

After a while stuck on this, I moved on to the [script](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/feat/install_theme/format-content.sh). It was quite simple; all I need to do was use the `mv` command to change all files from `.md` to `.pt.md` and then move them to the `blog` directory so that the part I already had can add the author to all of them.

Today is Monday, day 338 of 365 (92.60%). We're in week 49 of 52 (94.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] fix PATH with [ansible-debian](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/ansible-debian)
- [x] learn about google login in Flutter and implement login to the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client) using [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#:~:text=Test%2Ddriven%20development%20(TDD),software%20against%20all%20test%20cases.)

## Activities executed

Today I fixed PATH with ansible-debian, at some point in the past I accidentaly removed `bin` from it, so I tried to update [.zshrc](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/ansible-debian/blob/main/playbooks/dotfiles/.zshrc) and run the [shell playbook](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/ansible-debian/blob/main/playbooks/shell.yaml) but it was not updating the `~/.zshrc` file. Me and Mauricio digured out it was because of the script used `sudo`, so it was in the root and not the user. To fix it I [moved the `become: true`](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/ansible-debian/commit/312c6ca5fa525c1d3bee2cffc4010a0e808206f4) so that it is not used when installing dotfiles.

After fixing ansible-debian, I started taking a look at login with Flutter. Using google to login seemed to advanced, so Mauricio and I agreed that it's better to take a look at the basics first, and then move on to that later. We also gave up on using TDD for now, maybe when I am more familiar with testing and Flutter itself I can go back to trying it. As for the [login page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/lib/login.dart) it only does some form validation for now, I'll start on the username/password authentication tomorrow.

## Learnings

After running `make dotfile` and `source ~/.zshrc` to update the PATH I got an error message from oh-my-zsh:

```
error: cannot open .git/FETCH_HEAD: Permission denied
There was an error updating. Try again later?
```

Taking a better look at the `.git/FETCH_HEAD` file in the `.oh-my-zsh` repository we saw that the owner was marked as root:

```
➜  .oh-my-zsh git:(master) ll .git/FETCH_HEAD
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 103 Oct  4 08:12 .git/FETCH_HEAD
```

So we used the following to change that:

```
➜  .oh-my-zsh git:(master) sudo chown -R omnicoder.omnicoder .git/*
```

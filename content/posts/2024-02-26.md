Today is Monday, day 057 of 366 (15.57%). We're in week 09 of 52 (17.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I started the day determined to fix the failing tests, but nothing worked AGAIN. I tried moving things around, changed the [paths in the Routing class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/c8e37070e3e7c3c1702ae3e086b1e4d54a91bfd2/lib/routing.dart#L9C2-L12C48), changed the order I declared/called some things, but nothing worked. I can't for the life of me figure out why the navigation works from the login page to the view snippets page but doesn't work from the add snippet page to the view snippet page.

I did figure out that the routing is the only problem with the [save button](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/c8e37070e3e7c3c1702ae3e086b1e4d54a91bfd2/lib/add_snippet.dart#L194C25-L209C23), it posts the new snippet correctly; it just fails to go back to the view snippets page.

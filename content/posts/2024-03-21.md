Today is Thursday, day 081 of 366 (22.13%). We're in week 12 of 52 (23.07%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Powered by GitHub Pages instead of Netlify](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/123)
- [x] [Redo all links](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/121)
- [x] [Change social media links](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/129)
- [x] [Fix blog redirection in the home page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/130)

## Activities executed

Today I made PRs for all the remaining issues: changing Netlify to GitHub Pages and redoing all the links was really easy. For the first one, all it took was changing the [footer info](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/598b7c6514c7302629cc2c30aa5f753763be3595/config.toml#L128C1-L131C1) in `config.toml`, and for the second, I just had to run a `sed` command:

```bash
sed -i 's/worklog-luisa/blog/g' content/blog/*.md
```

It replaced all occurrences of "worklog-luisa" in the `content/blog` directory with "blog". I added this to the project as a [script](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/redo_links/redo_links.sh) in case I need to run it again later.

Fixing the blog redirection in the home page was the most time-consuming out of the four. I wasn't sure what I was going to do, so I tried changing the index markdown files in the [`content` directory](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/tree/home_links/content) so that they would somehow know the current URL and proceed accordingly. After a while, I realized there was no way to do that, and I had to use the template to get the correct URL. In the end, I added a path variable to the index files and used that in the template with a `get_url()` function.

Lastly, I changed all the [social media links in the `config.toml` file](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/c18bd50b76f6c4af032e206a311ed7e5da480973/config.toml#L91C1-L133C12) to Omnicode's socials. I also added LinkedIn and changed Twitter's logo to the new one. It took me a while to find the paths - I eventually found them in Bootstrap docs - but other than that, it was quite a simple fix.

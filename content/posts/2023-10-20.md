Today is Friday, day 293 of 365 (80.27%). We're in week 42 of 52 (80.76%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] [secret handshake](https://exercism.org/tracks/dart/exercises/secret-handshake)
- [ ] [forth](https://exercism.org/tracks/dart/exercises/forth)

## Activities executed

Today I finished the [secret handshake exercise](https://github.com/LuCCoelho/Exercism-Solutions/tree/main/dart/secret-handshake) from Exercism's Dart track. I aso started the forth exercise.

## Learnings

By starting the forth exercise I learned about [error handlind](https://dart.dev/language/error-handling) and the [Exception](https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.1.4/dart-core/Exception-class.html) and [Error](https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.1.4/dart-core/Error-class.html) classes in Dart.

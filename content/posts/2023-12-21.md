Today is Thursday, day 355 of 365 (97.26%). We're in week 51 of 52 (98.07%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] work on the tests for [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1)'s login page
- [ ] start the [snippets CRUD](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/2)

## Activities executed

Today I thought I could finish the tests for the login page, but I'm having some trouble with them. I believe that when I [check if the token is correct](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/603222cf1a5e269cdf8ffbfeaaf95dd7b85d172e/test/login_test.dart#L130C4-L130C37) the code looks to [Login's class static token variable](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/603222cf1a5e269cdf8ffbfeaaf95dd7b85d172e/lib/login.dart#L10), but I couldn't figure out how to solve that. Analyzing the [mock](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/test/login_test.mocks.dart), I couldn't find the token variable, and I think that confirms my suspicious. I tried researching and found some things on static methods, but not static variables.

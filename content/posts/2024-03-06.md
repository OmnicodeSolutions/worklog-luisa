Today is Wednesday, day 066 of 366 (18.03%). We're in week 10 of 52 (19.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Continue installing adidoks theme to this blog](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)

## Activities executed

Today I continued applying the Adidoks theme to the blog, and I was able to get the CSS to work, so it looks much better now. The problem was that when importing `base.html`, the Adidoks files were importing my old `base.html` because of what I said yesterday about the templates outside the themes overriding the templates inside the themes. That is also why the macros weren't getting imported, and I had to copy them to other HTML files. I discovered that after inspecting the page and realizing that the `head` tag was the same from my `base.html`.

I still have to create new authors and make a script to update all the files for me so that I don't have to, besides updating the current script to create new blog posts so that they have the author as well. I also need to apply the theme to the Portuguese pages, for which I believe I'll still have to use my own templates, but import Adidoks' `base.html` and `section.html`.

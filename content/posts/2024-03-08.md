Today is Friday, day 068 of 366 (18.57%). We're in week 10 of 52 (19.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Configure authors for the blog](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)

## Activities executed

Today I finished configuring the authors. I tried searching for another way to fix the error from yesterday, but I read dozens of GitHub issues and online discussions and nothing helped me, so I decided to just move the authors files to the main content folder and leave it as a permanent fix (at least for now). 

I updated the templates for the daily entries, both in [english](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/main/daily-template.md) and [portuguese](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/main/template-diario.md) so that the new entries are created with the taxonomies tag and the authors field. I also updated the [new blog script](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/main/new-blog.sh) so that the author is me by default but can be passed as an argument from the command line.

I also started planning for the script that will add me as the author to all existing blog entries and me and Mauricio agree that the strategy I presented yesterday is the best: copy the first lines to a new document, add the author, copy the rest of the old file and then replace it with the new one.

## Learnings

Today I learned that the `get_section` has the content folder in the root of the project as it's base path accondingly to this [Zola templates documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/overview/#get-section).

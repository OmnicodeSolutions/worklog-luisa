Today is Friday, day 300 of 365 (82.19%). We're in week 43 of 52 (82.69%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] [learn QR Code capture with Flutter](https://github.com/orgs/OmnicodeSolutions/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=41028440)

## Activities executed

Today I used the [qr_code_scanner Dart plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/qr_code_scanner) to make a simple QR Code scanner example.

I also took a look at some [Flutter dashboards](https://flutterawesome.com/fintech-dashboard-clone-built-with-flutter/) and discussed briefly about the theme of the [OmniQRCodes](https://github.com/orgs/OmnicodeSolutions/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=42765059) app.

## Learnings

Today I learned about:
1. the `MaterialApp` class and how to use to [use themes](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes?gclid=CjwKCAjwv-2pBhB-EiwAtsQZFEuZbAeX0IHF0OFDrALpoA6Qzu-zfo84LoNeXdQoySCD2JdVaAOe9RoCKkkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) on a Flutter project using `theme: ThemeData` to share colors and font styles;
2. the [`FloatingActionButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FloatingActionButton-class.html) class and how it differs from the `ElevatedButton` class for being over the rest of the app's content;
3. the `Barcode` type, which stores the the QR Code's output text as property 'code' of type `String`
4. the `toggleFlash()`, `getFlashStatus()`, `pauseCamera()` and `resumeCamera()` methods from the qr_code_scanner Dart plugin;
5. the `MediaQuery` class, that allowed me to keep the scanner size up to date with the current screen metrics as they change.

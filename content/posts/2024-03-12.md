Today is Tuesday, day 072 of 366 (19.67%). We're in week 11 of 52 (21.15%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Install Adidoks theme to the portuguese pages](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)

## Activities executed

Today I realized that the pages in portuguese were already working; I just wasn't looking in the right place. From [Zola's documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/multilingual/) yesterday, I assumed that the pages would be at `127.0.0.1:1111/blog/pt/` since I thought the language code would always come last, but I was wrong: the pages are at `127.0.0.1:1111/pt/blog/`.

After I figured that out, I started working on the authors. I made the `.pt.md` files for the page's content and duplicated Adidoks' templates but changed the files it would look for, but it's not working. The `/pt/authors/` page exists but doesn't show the authors I have (which is just me). Maybe I'm not sure what I'm missing, but maybe it's just something else I have to change in the template.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to use `mv` in a for loop to rename multiple files:

```bash
$ for i in *.log; do mv -- "$i" "${i%.log}.txt"; done
```

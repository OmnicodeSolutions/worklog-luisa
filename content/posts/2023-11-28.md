Today is Tuesday, day 332 of 365 (90.95%). We're in week 48 of 52 (92.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] work on unit tests for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today Mauricio helped me progress in the unit tests problem, I was not able to finish them, but I did some good progress. We changed from, nock to [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito/install) and I am now using [dependency injection](https://medium.com/flutter-community/dependency-injection-in-flutter-f19fb66a0740) to rewrite the constructor in [main.dart](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/test/mockito/lib/main.dart).

## Learnings

Today I learned about mockito, which is another dart mock generator, [named parameters](https://flutterbyexample.com/lesson/function-arguments-default-optional-named) and [static access](https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages?utm_source=dartdev&utm_medium=redir&utm_id=diagcode&utm_content=static_access_to_instance_member#static_access_to_instance_member) and how they work in Flutter.

I also did some readings on classes, methods and variables naming.

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] [start worklog blog with Zola](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/1)
- [x] [automate blog's deploy with github-actions](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/1)

## Activities executed

Today I studied Zola's documentation and made all templates for the blog in english, I also configured github-actions to auto publish it when pushing in the main branch.

Today is Thursday, day 348 of 365 (95.34%). We're in week 50 of 52 (96.15%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] continue working on [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)'s login page

## Activities executed

Today I finished the login page, it now has a static variable to keep the user's token. To get the token I just post the username and password given to the `auth-token` endpoint:

```dart
final response = await http.post(
          Uri.parse('http://your.url'),
          body: {'username': username, 'password': password});
```

and return the token:

```dart
var data = jsonDecode(response.body.toString());
return data['token'];
```

I also [closed all endpoints](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/tree/close_endpoints), so now even the GET requests require authorization.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to close the endpoints from an API by simply removing the request you want to request authorization for from SAFE_METHODS in `/env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/rest_framework/permissions.py` and adding `permission_classes` array to the views. The permission class looks top the safe methods to check if the current method needs authentication. This is the default permission (in permissions.py):

```python
// ...

class IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly(BasePermission):
    """
    The request is authenticated as a user, or is a read-only request.
    """

    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return bool(
            request.method in SAFE_METHODS or
            request.user and
            request.user.is_authenticated
        )

// ...
```

to use it in the view you just have import it and define the `permission_classes` array:

```python
from rest_framework import permissions

// ...
class ExampleView(APIView): // I used it with APIView, ReadOnlyModelViewSet and ModelViewSet
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]

```

Today is Tuesday, day 051 of 366 (13.93%). We're in week 08 of 52 (15.38%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish view snippets new test
- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I tried to figure out where to put the Routing class, but nothing seemed to work. I'm not sure if I have to run some command first or if I'm just putting it in the wrong place, but as I was trying to figure that out, I ended up reading the [MaterialApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html) class and I found this:

```dart
/// This example shows how to create a [MaterialApp] that uses the [routes]
/// `Map` to define the "home" route and an "about" route.
///
/// ```dart
/// MaterialApp(
///   routes: <String, WidgetBuilder>{
///     '/': (BuildContext context) {
///       return Scaffold(
///         appBar: AppBar(
///           title: const Text('Home Route'),
///         ),
///       );
///     },
///     '/about': (BuildContext context) {
///       return Scaffold(
///         appBar: AppBar(
///           title: const Text('About Route'),
///         ),
///       );
///      }
///    },
/// )
/// ```
```

I believe I have to apply this on my Widgets so that the test method I'm trying works, but I'm not sure yet. Tomorrow I'll finish reading everything to see if something else in there can help me.

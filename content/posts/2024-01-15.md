Today is Monday, day 015 of 366 (4.09%). We're in week 03 of 52 (5.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] work on the [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)

## Activities executed

Today I progressed a bit in the eddit snippet page, but there is something wrong with the new [FutureBuidler](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html) I created to handle the snippet's data, I keep getting an overflow error:

```
Another exception was thrown: A RenderFlex overflowed by 99607 pixels on the
right.
```

At first I thought it has something to do with the fact that I was using two future builders in the same widget, but when I comment one the error still appears, so it is most likely something in this new one.

## Learnings

Today I learned about the `obscureText` property from the [TextFormField widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAzJOtBhALEiwAtwj8tq6jtgEzDnoNaigpXJBHKhCQPJ8vhltU22yAokPM9lo7AcPMqCzHehoCINEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) that can be set to true to hide what the user enters.

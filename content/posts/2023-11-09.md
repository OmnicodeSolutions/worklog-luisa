Today is Thursday, day 313 of 365 (85.75%). We're in week 45 of 52 (86.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

### snippets Client
- [x] Work on the flutter client
- [x] Create github actions yaml
- [] Implement unit tests

### snippets API
- [x] Create github actions yaml
- [x] Add pre-commit default actions and black linter to github actions
- [] Implement unit tests
- [] Add unit tests to github actions

## Activities executed

Today I I added two dropdowns with the style and language options to the Flutter client and added pre-commit basic configuration and the github-actions folder to it. I also added the gh-actions folder to the API.

## Learnings

Today I learned about the [DropdownButton class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/DropdownButton-class.html?v=1.0.22&gclid=Cj0KCQiAo7KqBhDhARIsAKhZ4uj_sxFdzwUVYsPfwzXsSkOBewspfYZ8JSd050ACIO-fINXfmvFo1SwaAkkOEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) which allowed me to create the dropdowns with the language and style options from the API and feel like I'm getting better at handling Flutter's types, when I got any errors about that I was able to fix it easily.

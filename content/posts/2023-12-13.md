Today is Wednesday, day 347 of 365 (95.06%). We're in week 50 of 52 (96.15%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] differentiate development and production constants for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to run the Flutter Client using an emulator, after testing it a got a couple exceptions, but I was able to fix them and everything works fine now.

## Learnings

Today I learned:

1. How to use an emulator with flutter:

```bash
flutter emulators # to check if there are any emulators
flutter emulators --launch emulatorID # to start the emulator
flutter run # the emulator should appear as a device option or flutter will automatically use it
```

2. That the localhost to Android devices is `10.0.2.2` instead of `127.0.0.1`, which caused the first exception I mentioned in the previous section:

```bash
ClientException with SocketException: Connection refused (OS Error: Connection refused, errno = 111), address = 127.0.0.1, port = 41370, uri=http://127.0.0.1:8000.
```

3. Devices that use Android 12 or later have a new feature called 'back button handling' and it needs to be enabled in the [Android Manifest](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) by adding `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback` to the `<application>` tag, it will look something like this:

```xml
<application
    android:name="io.flutter.app.FlutterApplication"
    android:label="YourAppName"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true">
    <!-- ... -->
</application>
```

This missing line was what caused this warning:

```bash
W/WindowOnBackDispatcher( 9971): OnBackInvokedCallback is not enabled for the application.
W/WindowOnBackDispatcher( 9971): Set 'android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"' in the application manifest.
```

Keep in mind that the app worked perfectly without this configuration, but when I ooked into it and discovered what it was I thought it was better to keep the app up to date.

Today is Thursday, day 074 of 366 (20.21%). We're in week 11 of 52 (21.15%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Configure authors for the entries in portuguese](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)

## Activities executed

Today I discovered I spent the whole day trying to understand why the author was not working in the entries in Portuguese. I even tried to go back to using the same taxonomy for both languages to see if maybe I missed something and it was possible, but couldn't make it work. Just a couple of minutes ago, I found this [feature request](https://zola.discourse.group/t/different-page-languages-without-multilingual-site/1958/5) on Zola's website and realized that there is no way to do what I want with Zola by using `.pt.md` files, and I have to manually set a language parameter in the extra section of `config.toml` and use that on the pages to check for what I want to do.

## Learnings

Today I learned more about the taxonomies and its templates. The `list.html` template comes with the following variables:

```ts
// The site config
config: Config;
// The data of the taxonomy, from the config
taxonomy: TaxonomyConfig;
// The current full permalink for that page
current_url: String;
// The current path for that page
current_path: String;
// All terms for that taxonomy
terms: Array<TaxonomyTerm>;
// The lang of the current page
lang: String;
```

And I believe the last one can be quite useful for doing what I want, since I'm going to have to do it manually. The `single.html` template gets similar variables:

```ts
// The site config
config: Config;
// The data of the taxonomy, from the config
taxonomy: TaxonomyConfig;
// The current full permalink for that page
current_url: String;
// The current path for that page
current_path: String;
// The current term being rendered
term: TaxonomyTerm;
// The lang of the current page
lang: String;
```

Again, the `lang` variable may come in handy.

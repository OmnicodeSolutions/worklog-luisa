Today is Monday, day 008 of 366 (2.18%). We're in week 02 of 52 (3.84%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] work on the tests for [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1)'s login page
- [ ] start the [snippets CRUD](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/2)


## Activities executed

Today I was able to make two of the last three tests work. I realized that for [these two](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/edbb9c734c720be903ef7a6de39d0d90a70bb5a9/test/login_test.dart#L61C2-L99C6), I don't need to check the token itself; I just have to verify if the [failed login message](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/edbb9c734c720be903ef7a6de39d0d90a70bb5a9/lib/login.dart#L83C17-L91C21) appears.

The third test is a bit trickier, and I'm still having trouble trying to get around the static token. I did make a little progress since I am now able to mock the [login function](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/edbb9c734c720be903ef7a6de39d0d90a70bb5a9/lib/login.dart#L13C3-L26C4). I just had to move it to the Login class instead of its state. To get the test working, I tried adding another non-static variable to use, but it didn't solve the issue. So maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way and the static variable is not even the real problem. I also tried mocking the login function in the [setup](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/edbb9c734c720be903ef7a6de39d0d90a70bb5a9/test/login_test.dart#L13C3-L17C6), as I did in the [edit snippets test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/edbb9c734c720be903ef7a6de39d0d90a70bb5a9/test/edit_snippet_test.dart#L16C3-L28C6), but that didn't seem to change anything.

## Learnings

Today I learned about a new widget that I believe will be very useful in the future. The [OverlayPortal](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/OverlayPortal-class.html) widget can be used to create an overlay without breaking inheritance, which means it can be very handy for popups and menus.

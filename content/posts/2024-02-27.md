Today is Tuesday, day 058 of 366 (15.84%). We're in week 09 of 52 (17.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I was abel to get the ['logout button leads to login page' test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/c8e37070e3e7c3c1702ae3e086b1e4d54a91bfd2/test/view_snippets_test.dart#L113C3-L129C6) to pass. I'm not sure why, but when I changed the login route to "/login" and the view route to "/" it passes. Maybe there's something about this in the Navigator file.

 I tested to see if that also solved the redirection after saving a new snippet problem and something funny is going on: the page does not change but there is no error message.

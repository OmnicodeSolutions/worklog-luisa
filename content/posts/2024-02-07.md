Today is Wednesday, day 038 of 366 (10.38%). We're in week 06 of 52 (11.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] finish infinite scrolling
- [x] fix tests

## Activities executed

Today I replaced the `for` loop with a [while loop](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/a01d4722efcbdce0057483de5092d7a93179d8da/lib/api_service.dart#L26C5-L40C6) so that the app can load all existing pages from the API.

I was also able to fix all the tests that broke when I removed the [login function](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/a01d4722efcbdce0057483de5092d7a93179d8da/lib/api_service.dart#L57C3-L70C4) from the Login class. I started writing one more test for the [view snippets page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/view_snippets.dart) that is going to make sure it loads the [add snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/add_snippet.dart) once the add button is tapped, but something goes wrong with the Navigator, and I think I have to mock something. I found this [blog](https://iiro.dev/writing-widget-tests-for-navigation-events/) that may help me fix it.

I had to make the Login constructor not `const` to pass it the APIService mock when testing, but that raised that warning about immutable classes again, so I'll have to look into that.

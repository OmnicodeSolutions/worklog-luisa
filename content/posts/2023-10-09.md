## Planning

What I am going to do today:

## Activities executed

Today I finished the script for creating a new blog entry, wrote last week's activities in both brazilian portuguese and english, changed the keyboard settings to write in brazilian portuguese more easily and created all the templates for pages in brazilian portuguese. I also started the github-actions to test the dart exercises.

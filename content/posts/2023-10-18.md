## Activities executed

Today I started and finished [the binary search tree exercise](https://github.com/LuCCoelho/Exercism-Solutions/tree/main/dart/binary-search-tree) from Exercism's Dart track.

## Learnings

Today I learned about [null safety in Dart](https://dart.dev/null-safety/understanding-null-safety) and how 
```
<Type>? != <Type>
```

I also aquired a better understanding of [getters and setters in Dart](https://dev.to/newtonmunene_yg/dart-getters-and-setters-1c8f)

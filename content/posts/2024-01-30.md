Today is Tuesday, day 030 of 366 (8.19%). We're in week 05 of 52 (9.61%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] finish [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button

## Activities executed

Today I was finally able to figure out what was going on with the save button. After some more research and trying different things, I was trying to figure out a way to get more information on the error, so I decided to print the response's body. The first few tries gave me nothing new, but I eventually got this:

```bash
I/flutter (11411): BODY: {"language":["\"ABAP\" is not a valid choice."]}
```

Which didn't make a lot of sense to me at first because there is, in fact, an 'ABAP' option in the dropdown menu. But then I remembered that the options endpoint has two instances of each option, one is the original and the other is lowercase, like this:

```
{
    "languages": [
        ["Python", "py"],
        ["Dart", "dart"]
    ],
    "styles": [
        ["Formal", "formal"],
        ["Casual", "casual"]
    ]
}
```

I had bumped into this problem earlier when making the values list for the dropdowns because I only wanted the original name to be in the menu, but in this case, I had to go for the lowercase one. So all I had to do was use the `toLowerCase()` method, and it worked!

There are still some issues with the tests, and I also noticed that `flutter analyze` is picking up something in the CI that doesn't show in the command line, so tomorrow I'll be working on that and making new tests for the full edit snippet page.

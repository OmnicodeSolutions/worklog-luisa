Today is Friday, day 026 of 366 (7.10%). We're in week 04 of 52 (7.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button
- [x] make text fields read only if the user is not the snippet's owner

## Activities executed

Today I was not able to finish the save button, I figured out how to make the PUT request from the command line with HTTPie to see if that would help me undestand better what I'm doing wrong, but it didn't. I read the Flutter documentation on [updating data over the internet](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/update-data), and mine seems correct. Tomorrow, I'l try using pudb to debug the API and see if that helps.

I got really tired of the save button, so I moved on to disabling the text boxes and buttons if the user is not the snippet owner. I was not able to finish it because, apprently, Flutter does not provide a way to simply disable the dropdowns as it does for other widgets so I'll have to use a "replace widget" and Flutter will toggle wich one is loaded based on the user's ownership over the snippet, but I was able to make all the other work (I still have to write tests for them) by simply writing some functions to compare the user's username with the snippet's owner.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to make a PUT request using HTTPie in the command line:

```bash
http PUT :8000/snippets/1/ "Authorization:Token <token>" title="title"
```

I'm only using an Authorization header, but there are many others, and you can also PUT multiple key/value pairs separeting them with a blank space.

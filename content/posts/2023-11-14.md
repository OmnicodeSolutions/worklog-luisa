Today is Tuesday, day 318 of 365 (87.12%). We're in week 46 of 52 (88.46%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] close [issue#5](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/5) from [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)
- [ ] close [issue#1](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1) from [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to make the gh-actions run properly in the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client), I did not work on the login page from [issue#1](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1), instead I decided to make unit tests for the [dropdowns](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/pull/3). 

I also worked on a page for a Omnicode's client.

## Learnings

Today, while trying to fix the gh-action problem, I learned more about the [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout) and realized that was what I was missing. 

I am having some troubles making the unit tests, because I need to access `MyApp()`'s state to be able to check the information, but that is turning out to be a bit of a hastle. While trying to figure it out I learned about the [WidgetTester class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetTester-class.html) that can be used to load a widget tree besides providing quite a few usefull methods. I also read about how to [Find widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/widget/finders?gclid=CjwKCAiA0syqBhBxEiwAeNx9NxjUu3MhK9VXjtqEtKduUQx_UU0Z80fKA7ctsXimzKoSUITd5gPRLxoCp2UQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) using finders.

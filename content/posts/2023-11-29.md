Today is Wednesday, day 333 of 365 (91.23%). We're in week 48 of 52 (92.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish unit tests for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today I almost finished the unit tests, I was able to rewrite the constructors in [main.dart](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/test/mockito/lib/main.dart), but now I'm getting a strange error with mockito. I also did some pair programming with Mauricio.

## Learnings

Today I learned about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and how it helps build and run applications.

Today is Friday, day 061 of 366 (16.66%). We're in week 09 of 52 (17.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I read most of the Navigation class, but nothing in there helped me solve the problem so far. I'll finish it tomorrow, and if it still doesn't work, I'll either try testing this specific route in another way or go all the way back and use mockito instead of the stubbing method.

Today is Wednesday, day 080 of 366 (21.85%). We're in week 12 of 52 (23.07%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Fix blog CSS](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/122)
- [x] [Fix new blog script](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/124)
- [x] [Add Google analytics code](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/119)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to make PRs for all the issues from the planning plus the [translate month and search issue](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/120). The issues from the planning I already had an idea on how to fix, so they went by quite fast. 

Fixing the CSS was just a matter of changing the necessary links from `worklog-luisa` to `blog`. 

Fixing the [new blog script](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/main/new-blog.sh) was just changing one line; instead of creating a new `.md` file in the `blog_pr_br` directory (which no longer exists), it now creates a `.pt.md` file in the `blog` directory. 

Adding Google Analytics was just copying a code into [`base.html`](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/main/themes/adidoks/templates/base.html), but I don't know if it's working yet, so this issue may not be ready to close yet.

Lastly, I went back to trying to figure out a way to translate the [header macro](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/main/themes/adidoks/templates/macros/header.html) without having access to a page so that I could use `page.lang` to select the correct data file like I did for the other macros. After a lot of researching and not finding anything, I noticed that [Zola's shortcodes documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/) was popping out a lot. I knew it wasn't what I was looking for, but I decided to take a look anyway, and right at the end of the website, it was talking about the `lang` variable:

"Every shortcode can access the current language in the `lang` variable in the context."

Which means I don't need a page so that I can access that page's language; I just use `lang` and get the context's language, so I used that for the header and all other macros, and it works perfectly.

## Learnings

Today I learned that I can use the `lang` variable in any template's shortcode to access the context's language.

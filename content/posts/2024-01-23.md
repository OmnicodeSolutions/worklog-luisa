Today is Tuesday, day 023 of 366 (6.28%). We're in week 04 of 52 (7.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] configure [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button

## Activities executed

Today I did a lot of research but didn't find anything that helped me fixing the API. When I try to make a PUT or DELETE request the API makes a GET request to a new weird URL.

When I try the PUT method:
```bash
GET /snippets/1/?title=test&code=print%28%27hello+world%21%27%29&linenos=true&language=python&style=vs HTTP/1.1" 200 70673
```

When I try the DELETE method:
```bash
GET /snippets/1/? HTTP/1.1" 200 69849
```

I spent the whole morning on this and still have no ideia what the problem is, I opened a [new issue](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/issues/22) on GitHub and will probably need some help.

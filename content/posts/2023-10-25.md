Today is Wednesday, day 298 of 365 (81.64%). We're in week 43 of 52 (82.69%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] [start Flutter codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first?hl=pt-br#0)

## Activities executed

Today I started and finished the [namer app](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/flutter_codelab/tree/main/name_app) Flutter codelab. I also started and finished the [sign in example](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/flutter_codelab/tree/main/signin_example) from [Flutter codelabs](https://docs.flutter.dev/codelabs).

## Learnings

Today, I learned a great deal about Flutter, including:

1. How to utilize `Column()`, `Row()`, `ListView()`, and `ListTile()`.
2. When to choose between Stateless and Stateful widgets.
3. Understanding how `Expanded()` and `SafeArea()` operate.
4. How to employ `NavigationRail()` to create a navigation rail and manage selected items using `selectedIndex`.
5. Crafting responsive layouts with `LayoutBuilder()`.
6. The art of refactoring using VSCode.

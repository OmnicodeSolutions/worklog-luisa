Today is Monday, day 078 of 366 (21.31%). We're in week 12 of 52 (23.07%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] [Translate all elements of the pages in portuguese](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)

## Activities executed

Today I wasn't able to translate every single element on all pages, but I made really good progress on it. I found a way to not hard code anything and use the same macros and templates for entries in both English and Portuguese. Basically, all I did was create files with the translations I need [for English](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/feat/install_theme/data/en-translations.toml) and [for Portuguese](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/feat/install_theme/data/pt-translations.toml) and import what I need in each [macro](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/tree/feat/install_theme/themes/adidoks/templates/macros). I use the page's `lang` variable to set what file I want to get using:

```html
load_data(path='data/' ~ page.lang ~ '-translations.toml')
```

which is easy when you already have the page (like in the [page publish metadata macro](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/feat/install_theme/themes/adidoks/templates/macros/page-publish-metadata.html)), but becomes a bit more tricky in other macros. With the [section navigation macro](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/feat/install_theme/themes/adidoks/templates/macros/section-navigation.html) I was able to add the page as a parameter and I just pass the first page from the paginator to it, but with the [header macro](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/feat/install_theme/themes/adidoks/templates/macros/header.html) I'm not sure what to do yet. One way or another, I believe I can finish this tomorrow and then add Google Analytics and do any minor adjustments.

## Learnings

Today I learned that Git does not track empty directories; it only tracks files, which means that when I pushed the empty templates folder, it just ignored it which caused Zola to fail building the website. To fix that I just added a `.gitkeep` file; you can give the file any other name, `.gitkeep` is just a convention. I read that some people like to add a `README` file explaining why the directory is empty and why it needs to be there.

I also learned a little more about [pagination with Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/pagination/) and how you can use the `pages` variable to access an array of all pages for the current pager.

Today is Thursday, day 334 of 365 (91.50%). We're in week 48 of 52 (92.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish unit tests for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today I worked on the tests all morning, but I am still having issues with [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito). I even asked Chat GPT for help, but it didn't help me, so I'm going to try to go back to [nock](https://pub.dev/packages/nock), but using what I learned this past couple days.

## Learnings

Today I learned more about mockito, more specifically about the `thenReturn()` and `thenAnswer()` methods and when to use each one. I also read about Dart's [build runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner), which I thought would solve the problem, but it did not.

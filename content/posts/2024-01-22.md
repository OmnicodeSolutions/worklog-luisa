Today is Monday, day 022 of 366 (6.01%). We're in week 04 of 52 (7.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] configure [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button
- [x] fix logout button

## Activities executed

Today I fixed the logout button, I believe the env file just needed some time to load, because when I ran the app today it didn't give that same error, but there was a new issue: the route that was leading to the login page after logout was allowing the user to go back to the previous state. I looked for a way to disable flutter's back button, and found [this](https://flutterdesk.com/disable-or-override-back-button-in-flutter/), which took me some time to be able to implement in the project, but in the end what I wanted was way more simple: all I had to do was set the `automaticallyImplyLeading` property from the [AppBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html) to false. 

## Learnings

Today I learned about the [PopScope class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PopScope-class.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7vLnoYzxgwMVAEJIAB1E5godEAAYASAAEgKnifD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) that can be used to disable flutter's back button by setting `canPop` to false or execute some code on back press using the `onPopInvoked` parameter, keep in mind that the disabled button still shows on the page.

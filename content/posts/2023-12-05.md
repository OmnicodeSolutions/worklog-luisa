Today is Tuesday, day 339 of 365 (92.87%). We're in week 49 of 52 (94.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] differentiate development and production constants in [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)
- [x] continue working on [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)'s login page

## Activities executed

Today I worked I didn't work on the login page itself, but I progressed on the topic by working on the [API](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial).

## Learnings

Today I learned about authentication with the the [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and added a token authentication endpoint to the API using the [`obtain_auth_token` view](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#by-exposing-an-api-endpoint).

I'm using [httpie](https://httpie.io/) and to generate a token you just have to post to the endpoint, in my case `auth-token/`, with the username and password of the user like so:

```bash
http POST :8000/auth-token/ password='password' username='username'
```

I am still having some trouble figuring out how to really use the token as an authenticator, but accordingly to the [httpie documentation](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/authentication) it should look something like this:

```bash
http -A bearer -a 448b01551721565eaa5f0aff2e33c206ce571c5a :8000/snippets/ code="print(123)"
```

I also found a few websites (like [this one](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/11/22/how-to-implement-token-authentication-using-django-rest-framework.html)) saying that I should use something like this:

```bash
http :8000/endpoint/ 'Authorization: Token 9054f7aa9305e012b3c2300408c3dfdf390fcddf'
```

but I couldn't make it work for POST requests.

To authenticate with the username and password ([basic authetication](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/basic-auth)) we use this:

```bash
http -a username:password :8000/snippets/ code="print(123)"
```

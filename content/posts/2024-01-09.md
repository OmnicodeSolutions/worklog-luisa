Today is Tuesday, day 009 of 366 (2.45%). We're in week 02 of 52 (3.84%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] finish the tests for [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1)'s login page
- [ ] start the [snippets CRUD](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/2)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to finish the login page's last test, as it turns out the problem was not the static variable but the fact that I was not using the mock, so I changed the [Login class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/lib/login.dart) and now it takes the mock as a parameter and uses it, if the mock's null, then it'll just use the original [login function](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/5c499c0f942b4887aa7ef9236fea0f174886e65f/lib/login.dart#L14C3-L27C4) instead of the [mocked one](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/5c499c0f942b4887aa7ef9236fea0f174886e65f/test/login_test.dart#L14C1-L16C8). The code is definetly not perfect, but I don't have the knowledge to make it better right now so I will revisit it in the future.

The only thing left to do is correct a warning that's [breaking the CI](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/actions/runs/7462142184/job/20303790041), but that is connected to Mock so I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do it.

Today is Wednesday, day 024 of 366 (6.55%). We're in week 04 of 52 (7.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] configure [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button
- [ ] make text fields read only if the user is not the snippet's owner

## Activities executed

Today I was able to get the API running normally. The problem was linked to the static files not loading, an issue that I had been ignoring for a while because I thought static files did not interfere with the API functions. It turns out that when the [`DEBUG` option in the settings.py](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/blob/25db6e9e99a32a6d26f65dddc1d938344dbe8f3f/tutorial/tutorial/settings.py#L26C1-L26C13) file is set to false, Django REST won't handle static files for you anymore, and you'll need a production web server.

I tried finishing the save button, but I ran into some troubles. I have to access what is in the editable fields, and I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I'll have to move the button inside the [first FutureBuilder](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/4e5e3069ca240723071599011e4a95e702f9116b/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L84C15-L146C17), and find a way to make it stay at the end of the page, but I'll check on that tomorrow.

As for checking if the user is the owner of the snippet, I'm going to see if I can recover the username using the token. If not, I'll have to save it when the user logs in.

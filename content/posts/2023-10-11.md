Today is Wednesday, day 284 of 365 (77.80%). We're in week 41 of 52 (78.84%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] continue Dart track on Exercism

## Activities executed

Today I continued the Dart track on exercism, I finished the folowing exercises:
1. [armstrong numbers](https://github.com/LuCCoelho/Exercism-Solutions/tree/main/dart/armstrong-numbers)
2. [high scores](https://github.com/LuCCoelho/Exercism-Solutions/tree/main/dart/high-scores)

I also learned how to run a single test from a Dart test file in the command line using *dart test --name "< test_name >"* and about the 64bit limitation for integers and how to deal with numbers larger than that using [BigInt class](https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.1.3/dart-core/BigInt/BigInt.from.html).

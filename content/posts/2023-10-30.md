Today is Monday, day 303 of 365 (83.01%). We're in week 44 of 52 (84.61%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [ ] send a pull request for [flutter-examples#issue95](https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/issues/95)

## Activities executed

Today I made a calculator with Flutter to send it as a pull request for flutter-examples#issue95, I did finish the app itself, but I didn't have time to format it to the project's owner standards, so I didn't send the PR.

## Learnings

Today I learned about:
1. the `math_expressions` [Dart library](https://pub.dev/packages/math_expressions) for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions;
2. the `GridView` [class from Flutter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html), which can be used to create all kinds of grids, more specifically I used the `GridView.builder()` to make a more custom grid;
3. the `flex` parameter for the `Expanded` class and how it can help fitting things in the screen;
4. the `Border` [class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/Border-class.html), that can be used to outline containers.

I also deepened my knowledge in the `setState()` method and stateful widgets by learning how you can call this method inside a `onPressed` parameter like below:

```dart
onPressed: () {
    setState(() {
        ...
    });
},
```

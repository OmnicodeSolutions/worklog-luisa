Today is Thursday, day 011 of 366 (3.00%). We're in week 02 of 52 (3.84%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] continue [snippets visualization page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/view_snippets.dart)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to make the list with all the snippets work. I added a detail button that will lead to the [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart), but I have to make the tests for the snippets view first, which I'll be starting tomorrow. 

I still don't truly understand what was going wrong and why what I was trying was not working, but in the end I just used a [ListView builder](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/long-lists) and customized what I wanted to be shown in the [ListTile](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAwP6sBhDAARIsAPfK_wYYr-DXW66prUfVCn3mB1tonis77J3tBevWLCF_4VVrpGVqHKfVpH0aApYjEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).

## Learnings

Today I learned more about how to use the ListView builder and the ListTile widget, I also learned that you can use the `mainAxisAlignment` property from the Row widget to space out the children in different ways.

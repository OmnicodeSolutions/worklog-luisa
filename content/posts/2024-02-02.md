Today is Friday, day 033 of 366 (9.01%). We're in week 05 of 52 (9.61%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] fix [dropdown menus](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/18bb9918660dda017b6cde2fa53c1a430571113c/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L198C25-L251C27)'s initial values

## Activities executed

Today I fixed the dropdown menus' initial values, and now they show the real value from the API. The fix was a bit tricky, but not hard. I created another list with the other values from the options' pairs and used that to get the index of the snippet's language in the API and accessed that index in the dropdown options.

After I got that done, I had some time left, so I started and finished the [add snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/add_snippet.dart). Tomorrow, I'll just have to see if I can use the [save snippet function](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/aaeb61b8bf9c1d89766afe732834c8e02b2d197a/lib/api_service.dart#L61C3-L84C4) or if I have to make a new one.

## Learnings

Today, I learned about the [`FloatingActionButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FloatingActionButton-class.html) class and the `floatingActionButton` parameter that can be passed to the page's `body`:

```dart
//...
body: const Center(child: Text('Press the button below!')),
    floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {},
        child: const Icon(Icons.navigation),
    ),
//...
```

You can do a lot of customization, like background or foreground color, shape, or elevation. There are also a few variants:

1. `FloatingActionButton.small(onPressed: , child: )`
2. `FloatingActionButton.large(onPressed: , child: )`
3. `FloatingActionButton.extended(onPressed: , label: , icon:)`

Today is Thursday, day 025 of 366 (6.83%). We're in week 04 of 52 (7.69%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] configure [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)'s save button
- [ ] make text fields read only if the user is not the snippet's owner

## Activities executed

Today I made some progress on the button. I figured out how to get all the information that I need to make the PUT request, but for some reason, it doesn't work. I tried it a few different ways, and I either get a 400 error, a 415 error, or a Flutter error (in this last case, the PUT request is not made).

## Learnings

Today I learned that you can access the text in a text field by simply using the `text` getter in the controller (`myController.text`). I didn't have a controller in the text fields, so I had to adapt the [code](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/4e5e3069ca240723071599011e4a95e702f9116b/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L103C25-L122C27) a bit. I also learned that you can't have a controller and an initial value in the same text field (one of them has to be null), but you can give the controller an initial value by giving it the named parameter `text: "Initial value"`.

Today is Friday, day 349 of 365 (95.61%). We're in week 50 of 52 (96.15%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] create tests for GET requests in the [API](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial)

## Activities executed

Today I created the tests for GET requests in both [User view set](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/blob/a24871884614fb0e5edf43319e2212dfbaff8599/tutorial/snippets/tests/test_views.py#L137C1-L152C67) and [Options view set](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/blob/a24871884614fb0e5edf43319e2212dfbaff8599/tutorial/snippets/tests/test_views.py#L155C1-L170C67) in the API and continued to work on the login for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/tree/login). I'm having some troubles adapting the [ApiService class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/lib/api_service.dart) now that all endpoints are closed, the [login function](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/89bc061fa5fab5cdfcb0fb17db468cc2e2e2d848/lib/login.dart#L16C3-L34C4) is returning the token correctly but it doesn't seem to be saving it in the static token variable, I'll look more into it on Monday.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to pass a token to authorize a request in Flutter:

```dart
await http.get(
    Uri.parse('http://your.url'),
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer $token'}
);
```

Today is Tuesday, day 325 of 365 (89.04%). We're in week 47 of 52 (90.38%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] work on unit tests for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)

## Activities executed

Today was a short morning, we had a problem with the internet so I had to come back home to work. I was not able to finish the unit tests, bt I did advance a little.

## Learnings

Mauricio helped me realize that the problem was probably with [nock](https://pub.dev/packages/nock), so I read a little bit more about that. Now, the mock is apparently being created successfully, but it still does not work. My guess is the requests made from [main.dart](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/main.dart) are not actually using the mock, but I haven't figured out how to fix that yet.

Today is Tuesday, day 037 of 366 (10.10%). We're in week 06 of 52 (11.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] use infinite scrolling to load all pages from the API

## Activities executed

Today I did a lot of research on infinite scrolling, but I wasn't really understantding it, so I tried to take the concept and apply it in a simpler way to see if that would help and it did. I was able to load snippets from other pages, but the number of pages is fixed, because I couldn't find a way to check how many pages the REST framework has. I think I'll just have to use a while loop to keep going to the next page until there is a 404 error.

While working on the infinite scrolling I realized that the [login function](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/6b3dea29d764ed095cab2a478331573a23f8a3dd/lib/login.dart#L15C3-L28C4) was in the Login class and not on the [APIService class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/api_service.dart), so I changed that, whiich messed around with the tests, so I'll have to redo them tomorrow.

I also added a [DELETE button](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/6b3dea29d764ed095cab2a478331573a23f8a3dd/lib/edit_snippet.dart#L280C29-L292C67) to the edit snippet page.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to access an specific page on the API using `https://exampleapi.com?page=2&limit=50`.

I also learned how to style an `ElevatedButton`:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
    child: Text('Button'),
    onPressed: () {},
    style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom({
        Color backgroundColor:, 
        Color foregroundColor:,
        Color disabledForegroundColor:,
        Color shadowColor:,
        double elevation:,
        TextStyle textStyle:,
        EdgeInsetsGeometry padding:,
        Size minimumSize:,
        BorderSide side:,
        OutlinedBorder shape:,
        MouseCursor enabledMouseCursor:,
        MouseCursor disabledMouseCursor:,
        VisualDensity visualDensity:,
        MaterialTapTargetSize tapTargetSize:,
        Duration animationDuration:,
        bool enableFeedback:
     }),
),
```

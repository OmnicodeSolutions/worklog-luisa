Today is Monday, day 331 of 365 (90.68%). We're in week 48 of 52 (92.30%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] work on unit tests for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)
- [x] do pair programming with Mauricio for a Omnicode client

## Activities executed

Today I did a little bit of work in the unit tests, but was not able to advance much. 

I spent most of the morning helping Mauricio do some end-to-end tests with [VSCode's Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) for an Omnicode's project.

## Learnings

Today I leaned about VSCode's Playwright and how it can make writing tests easier by allowing you to record actions on your application, find elements, and much more.

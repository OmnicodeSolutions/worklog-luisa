Today is Thursday, day 039 of 366 (10.65%). We're in week 06 of 52 (11.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish view snippets new test
- [x] make tests for the [add snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/add_snippet.dart)

## Activities executed

Today, I wasn't able to finish the new test for the [view snippets page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/view_snippets.dart). The blog I mentioned yesterday used Mockito, and I tried applying the logic with Nock, but couldn't. I attempted to find something using Nock, but nothing helped. I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet; I might just use Mockito for this specific test.

When I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere with the new view snippets page test, I started making tests for the add snippet page and realized that I haven't made any tests for the buttons, which is why I didn't run into the Navigator issue earlier, even though I used it on every single page so far. So, once I figure out how to make it, I'll do it for all of them.

Lastly, I remembered the 'immutable class error' and just added `const` to the [login page constructor](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/9834606e616824957f02fc88ce753a70905df3af/lib/login.dart#L9) and all its calls.

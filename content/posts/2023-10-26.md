Today is Thursday, day 299 of 365 (81.91%). We're in week 43 of 52 (82.69%). 

## Planning

What I am going to do today: 

- [x] run Namer App on Android
- [x] [study Flutter](https://github.com/orgs/OmnicodeSolutions/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=41028440)

## Activities executed

Today I connected and Android device and ran the Namer App on it. I also [updated the app](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/flutter_codelab/tree/main/name_app) to allow the user to dislike a wordpair from the favorites page. For the Flutter studies, I covered the [networking](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data) and [camera](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/plugins/picture-using-camera) topics.

## Learnings

Today I learned about other [Buttons](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/buttons?gclid=CjwKCAjwnOipBhBQEiwACyGLutBAnkm3dR4tqgllKxGJ3HSG2fffnMYF0cqiJwPmg9qsDZrSfRoKKhoCfnYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) from Flutter and the [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http), [camera](https://pub.dev/packages/camera) and [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) packages.

I also found the [qr_code_scanner](https://pub.dev/packages/qr_code_scanner) plugin from Dart, that allows you to read a QR Code using either a IOS or Android phone.

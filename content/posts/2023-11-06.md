Today is Monday, day 310 of 365 (84.93%). We're in week 45 of 52 (86.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [finish DRF tutorial](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/tree/master/docs/tutorial)

## Activities executed

Today I finished the DRF tutorial and started working a bit more on the [repository](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial)

## Learnings

Today I learned about [.json files](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-load-in-python/) and [fixtures in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/db/fixtures/), in my case I used these concepts to create the [users.json](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/blob/main/tutorial/snippets/fixtures/users.json) file to create some initial users for the API, I also had to make a [migration](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/migrations/#data-migrations) to actually save the users previously mentioned to the data base and create and save a superuser (whose details are defined in the [project settings.py file](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial/blob/main/tutorial/tutorial/settings.py)).

While trying to make the new migration, I had some issues with reading the users.json file so I used [pudb](https://github.com/inducer/pudb) to debug it and found out that there were actually 2 users.json files and the second one was useless, so all I had to do was delete it and correct the path for the right one and it worked.

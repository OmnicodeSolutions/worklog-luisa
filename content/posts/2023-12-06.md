Today is Wednesday, day 340 of 365 (93.15%). We're in week 49 of 52 (94.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] continue working on [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client)'s login page

## Activities executed

Today I continued working on the login topic by trying to make the token authentication work on the [API](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial), but I had a hard time making progress. When I tried to make the post request:

```bash
http POST :8000/snippets/ "Authorization: Token <token>" code="print(123)"
```

I got:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Allow: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS
Content-Length: 58
Content-Type: application/json
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Date: Wed, 06 Dec 2023 14:14:53 GMT
Referrer-Policy: same-origin
Server: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.11.5
Vary: Accept, Cookie
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY

{
    "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

So it looked like httpie was not recognizing the authentication header, and I didn't know why yet. I asked Mauricio for help and he found that, besides `INSTALLED_APPS`, we should also update the `REST_FRAMEWORK` in the settings file, so they now look like this:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    ...
]

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ],
    ...
}
```

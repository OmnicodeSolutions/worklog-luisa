Today is Thursday, day 067 of 366 (18.30%). We're in week 10 of 52 (19.23%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Configure authors for the blog](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/4)

## Activities executed

Today I figured out what was wrong with the authors. When I tried adding 

```
[taxonomies] authors = ["Luísa Coelho"]
```

to a blog entry, I got this error:

```bash
Error: Failed to build the site
Error: Failed to render a list of authors page.
Error: Reason: Failed to render 'authors/list.html'
Error: Reason: Function call 'get_section' failed
Error: Reason: Section `authors/_index.md` not found.
```

Which made no sense to me because the `_index.md` file exists in this path. After a while of researching, it occurred to me that maybe something similar to what happened to the templates was happening to the content; the files outside the theme were overriding the ones inside the theme. So I tried just adding the authors folder to my content folder, and it worked, which means that Zola is just not searching for the content inside the theme. I do not think that is the right way to do this; there is probably a way to just use what is inside the theme, I just haven't figured it out yet.

After a while stuck on this, I decided to just leave it as a temporary fix and get started on the script to add the author to all files. I'm not sure how to do this; I couldn't find anything that would allow me to write on a certain line of the file, so I think I'll have to make a new file, copy the first part of the file, write the author, copy the rest, and replace the old one.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to write multiple lines in a file by setting a "stop word":

```bash
cat << EOF > file.txt
All this
lines
will be written
in the
file
EOF
```

I also learned about the `tee` command, which allows you to write in multiple files, which can be very useful to me:

```bash
echo "this is a line" | tee file_1.txt file_2.txt file_3.txt
```

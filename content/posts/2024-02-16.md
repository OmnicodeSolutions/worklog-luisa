Today is Friday, day 047 of 366 (12.84%). We're in week 07 of 52 (13.46%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish view snippets new test
- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I tried [this other method](https://ahmad-hamwi.medium.com/stubbing-navigation-routes-in-widget-integration-tests-in-your-flutter-app-51f71963d4d0) I found yesterday, but it doesn't seem to be working. I do believe I can stick to it a bit longer to better understand how it works and fix the errors. The difference between this approach and the one I tried yesterday is it doesn't use mocks; instead, it stubs the newly pushed route's widget, so we can test it by keeping track of the route.

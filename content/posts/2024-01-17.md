Today is Wednesday, day 017 of 366 (4.64%). We're in week 03 of 52 (5.76%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] work on the [edit snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/main/lib/edit_snippet.dart)

## Activities executed

Today I finished all the inputs on the edit snippet page and added the button that will send the PUT request to the API. I tried to finish the button today, but there seems to be something wrong with the API that I'll have to figure out tomorrow. Also, the current [test for the edit snippet page seems to be broken](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/actions/runs/7556718221/job/20574358659), but everything seems to work fine, so it's probably because of something I changed on the page.

## Learnings

Today I learned about the [CheckboxListTile widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/CheckboxListTile-class.html), which is a lot better than the Checkbox widget I was using, since it allows you to add a title, define active, hover, fill, check, and overlay colors, and a lot more options not offered by the second one.

I also learned that I can set the maxLines property from the [TextFormField widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html) to null so that the box will vertically grow to show the whole text inside.

Today is Monday, day 345 of 365 (94.52%). We're in week 50 of 52 (96.15%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] finish [API](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_tutorial)'s tests

## Activities executed

Today I finished the tests for the API, I wasn't completely right when I said the problem was the POST request was not being sent correctly, it was, the problem wa I was not 'saving' it before checking for the objects count. I also did some research on differentiating development and production constants for the [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client), but I'm still a bit lost and will read more tomorrow.

## Learnings

Today I learned to use:

```python
view = SnippetViewSet.as_view({"<request>": "<view set method>"})
response = view(request)
```
in my tests to save POST requests before checking anything. In DELETE and PUT requests I has to use:

```python
view = SnippetViewSet.as_view({"<request>": "<view set method>"})
response = view(request, pk=<id>)
```
I also learned how to change multiple commit messages with:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

This will show you the last `n` commits in the terminal, it will look something like this:

```bash
pick f7f3f6d feat: some commit message
pick 310154e chore: anoter commit
pick a5f4a0d fix: yet another commit

# Rebase 710f0f8..a5f4a0d onto 710f0f8
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

Here you can go ahead and change `pick` to `edit` in the commits you want to change, then save it and exit. After that you can use:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

to edit a commit and then

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

to go to next one masked as `edit`. After editiing all the commits, just use `git push --force` (or the alias `gpf`) to update the remote repository if you has already pushed them.

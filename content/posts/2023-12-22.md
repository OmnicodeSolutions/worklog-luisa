Today is Friday, day 356 of 365 (97.53%). We're in week 51 of 52 (98.07%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] work on the tests for [Flutter Client](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/1)'s login page
- [ ] start the [snippets CRUD](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/issues/2)

## Activities executed

Today I did some more research on how to make the test work, but I couldn't find anything. I tried making something similar to what it says [here](https://dev.to/manuelvargastapia/how-to-test-static-members-with-mockito-in-flutter-2139) but it didn't work. I was getting really frustrated and felt like I wasn't going anywhere so I decided to do something else for a while, so I updated the [Login page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/lib/login.dart) to not change pages when the login is unseccessful, instead it shows a login error message.

After I finished that update, I did some clean up and saw that the `flutter analyze` is catching some errors in github actions that don't show when I run it localy, but I didn't have time to look into it. There is also a warning from the [login mock](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/login/test/login_test.mocks.dart) file that I don't know what it means.

## Learnings

Today I learned that `setState(() {})` reloads the page and you can pass it local variables to update them. You can use this to have a variable to hide or not hide a Widget, all you have to do is make your class a stateful widget (if it's not one already), declare your variable, and use an `if(condition)` clause with the widget you want to hade/show. It will look something like this:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  MyHomePage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  bool _clicked = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            if (_clicked) Text('Button is clicked'), // If _clicked is true, the Text widget will be shown
            FlatButton(
              onPressed: () {
                setState(() {
                  _clicked = true;
                });
              },
              child: Text('Click me')
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

If you want to toggle the state and not just set it to false/true, you can just use if/else:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  MyHomePage({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  bool _clicked = false;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            if (_clicked) Text('Botão foi clicado'),
            FlatButton(
              onPressed: () {
                if (_clicked) {
                    setState(() {
                        _clicked = false
                    })
                } else {
                    setState(() {
                        _clicked = true
                    })
                }
              },
              child: Text('Clique em mim')
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

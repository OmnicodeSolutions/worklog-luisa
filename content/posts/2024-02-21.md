Today is Wednesday, day 052 of 366 (14.20%). We're in week 08 of 52 (15.38%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] finish view snippets new test
- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I was able to test if the navigation is correct by using the method I've been mentioning for the past couple of days. I found a link to the [article's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ahmad-Hamwi/testing-with-route-stubs-flutter/blob/main/lib/presentation/app/app.dart) and realized I was missing a few things on my pages. First, I had to add an initial route to [main.dart](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/main.dart) and tell it to use the logic in the [Routing class](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/routing.dart) whenever a new route was created, which was quite easy:

```dart
initialRoute: Routing.loginRoute,
onGenerateRoute: Routing.onGenerateRoute,
```

Using these takes out the need for the `home` parameter to be set, so the code will look something like this:

```dart
runApp(const MaterialApp(
    title: 'Login page',
    initialRoute: Routing.loginRoute,
    onGenerateRoute: Routing.onGenerateRoute,
));
```

I do intend to use the `theme` parameter here, but that will go in another PR.

Another thing I had to change was the way I was navigating to other pages. Instead of just using:

```dart
Navigator.push()
```

I had to make sure the new routing logic was being used:

```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
    Routing.exampleRoute, (route) => false,
    arguments: {});
```

Lastly, for the view snippets page to know that the initial route was the one I declared in the main file, I just had to make it return only the `Scaffold` widget instead of `MaterialApp`.

After I got the [add button route test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/338645779693472a281c1fc3244aab80e03206fe/test/view_snippets_test.dart#L95C1-L111C6) to work, I started changing other pages and testing other buttons, but I only had time to finish the [details button route test](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/338645779693472a281c1fc3244aab80e03206fe/test/view_snippets_test.dart#L75C1-L93C6), so I'll do all the others tomorrow.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to run a single test from a dart file using the `--plain-name` flag:

```bash
flutter test test/view_snippets_test.dart --plain-name 'Add button leads to add snippet page'
```

Today is Monday, day 036 of 366 (9.83%). We're in week 06 of 52 (11.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] finish [add snippet page](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/snippets_CRUD/lib/add_snippet.dart)
- [ ] start making tests for add snippet page

## Activities executed

Today I configured the save button on the add snippet page, and it used the same [function](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/240a2becb2c0d50e6344a9c141d1677e021ee430/lib/api_service.dart#L61C3-L108C4) as the save button from the edit snippet page. I found a couple of issues in other parts of the code along the way, so I was not able to start making the tests.

First, I found out that titles too large were causing that pixel overflow error, so I had to refactor the [part of the view snippet page with the Text widgets](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/luisa_drf_flutter_client/blob/240a2becb2c0d50e6344a9c141d1677e021ee430/lib/view_snippets.dart#L76C33-L105C35) to make sure that didn't happen again.

Second, I realized that when there are enough snippets, the API creates a second page, but the app only fetches the snippets from the first one. Mauricio told me about infinite scrolling and how it can solve this problem, so that's going to be one of my tasks for tomorrow.

## Learnings

Today I learned how to specify an optional positional argument in Dart; all you have to do is use brackets:

```dart
function_name(argument1, [argument2]) {
  // statements
}
```

I also learned how to deal with text overflow: first, I wrapped the text in a container and specified its width to half of the device's width, then I set the `softWrap` parameter from the `Text()` widget to false so that the whole text would be in one line, and lastly, I used the `overflow` parameter from the same widget to customize. It looks like this:

```dart
Container(
    width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 2,
    child: Text(
        'Example text',
        overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
        softWrap: false,
    ),
),
```

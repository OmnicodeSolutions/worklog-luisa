Today is Wednesday, day 312 of 365 (85.47%). We're in week 45 of 52 (86.53%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] learn about CSS

## Activities executed

Today I learned about [Tailwind CSS framework](https://tailwindcss.com/) and worked on a page for a Omnicode's client.

## Learnings

Today I learned about how Tailwind uses the class in html divs to apply css properties. The hardest part was making the background right, so I read about [backgound attachment](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-attachment), [background color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color), [background position](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-position), [background size](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-size) and [background image](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-image).

Today is Monday, day 050 of 366 (13.66%). We're in week 08 of 52 (15.38%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [ ] finish view snippets new test
- [ ] create tests for all buttons

## Activities executed

Today I reread the article with the solutions I tried on [friday](https://omnicode.com.br/blog/blog/2024-02-16/) multiple times to try and figure out why it's not working. I tried changing a few things to make it look more like what the author is doing, but it wasn't changing anything. When I was almost giving up, I found this: "*[...]the route-generating logic that I’ve provided to my MaterialApp at the __root of my app__*". I was not sure what he means by that, so I did a little research, and apparently I have to put the Routing class in a very specific place in the project so that it works. I saw a few different ways on how to get the path to the project root, but I'm sure it's just a tiny thing I'm missing, and I really hope I can get this done tomorrow.

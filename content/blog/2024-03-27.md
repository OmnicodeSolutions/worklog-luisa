Today is Wednesday, day 087 of 366 (23.77%). We're in week 13 of 52 (25.00%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Add link to Blog on Omnicode's website](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/website/issues/119)
- [x] Start learning React

## Activities executed

Today I checked out [Omnicode's website](https://omnicode.solutions/) with Mauricio, and we decided it would be good for me to learn some React and work on it a little bit. Today, I just added a new item to the navbar that will lead to the [blog](https://omnicode.com.br/blog/) and started watching some videos on Gatsby and React.

## Learnings

Today I learned about [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), [Deno](https://deno.com/), and [Bun](https://bun.sh/), which are all JavaScript runtimes. I also learned about [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), which are package and dependency managers for JavaScript (like pip for Python).

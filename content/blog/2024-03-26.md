Today is Tuesday, day 086 of 366 (23.49%). We're in week 13 of 52 (25.00%).

## Planning

What I am going to do today:

- [x] [Add button to toggle langauges](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/137)
- [x] [Rename blog section](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/issues/141)

## Activities executed

Today I was able to get the toggle language button to work on all pages. I used Tera's `join` function to set the [`current_section` variable in the blog's pages template](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/fdcd5359380aea28c9c7da89af2c6aef2418e8ae/themes/adidoks/templates/blog/page.html#L7C1-L7C76) and in the [authors' single template](https://github.com/OmnicodeSolutions/blog/blob/fdcd5359380aea28c9c7da89af2c6aef2418e8ae/themes/adidoks/templates/authors/single.html#L5C1-L5C87) so that I can get the URL from the same section, but in another language. 

I also renamed the blog section to posts so that the blog URL would be `https://omnicode.com.br/blog/posts/` instead of `https://omnicode.com.br/blog/blog/` and removed the Docs section and the 'Get started' button from the home page, since they were not being used.

## Learnings

Today I learned about [Tera's `join` function](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#join) that joins an array with a string:

```tera
{{ ['a', 'b' ] | join(sep=", ") }} {# output = "a, b" #}
```
